# GO template secrets
This project contains the result of my journey to understand GO templates.

File main.go is richly commented to explain just what goes on.

## Essentials
The essential thing to understand is that:
- Go templates are stored in a map[string]*Template;
- One named entry in that structure usually contains many templates.

Have fun!

Success
